# PuTTY

With **PuTTY** you can connect to a remote computer via Secure Shell (SSH) or Telnet. In addition you can connect to a local serial port. The integration of PuTTY with NETworkManger supports tabs and profiles for hosts. The connection can be established via a profile (double-click, Enter key or right-click `Connect`) or directly via the [connection](#connect) dialog.  

Right-click on the tab will open the context menu with the following options:

- **Reconnect** - Restart PuTTY and reconnect to the remote computer.
- **Resize** - Resize the PuTTY window to the current view size (if connected).
- **Restart session** - Restart the PuTTY session (if connected).
